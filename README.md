# platformer

A canvas based Mario Bros style platforming engine. I make extensive use of Classes to create instances of enemies, platforms, walls, and blocks. The app uses ES6 and is compliled with Webpack. The Arrow keys are used for movement and the space bar is for jumping.


Being a fan of 2d platform games for most of my life, I am intimently familiar with the mechanics of a 2d platformer, but I intentionally haven't researched any programming techninques for this type of game just to try to see what I can come up with on my own.
